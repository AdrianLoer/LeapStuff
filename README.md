# LeapStuff

this repo was used for various experiments with the LeapMotion device I got as part of a competition in 2015.

The following video shows the result, created as part of a 6 hour hackathon-like event. It uses BaconJS to handle bone movement, an OpenLayers 3 map to give it some visual output and BrainJS for a super simple and naive neural net based gesture recognition:
