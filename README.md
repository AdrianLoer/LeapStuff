# LeapStuff

This repo was used for various experiments with the LeapMotion device I got as part of a competition in 2015.

The final but incomplete submission can be seen [here on itch.io](https://aloer.itch.io/fingerarmangles). It uses three.js to visualize calculated angles between different bones and was intended to be used as debugging/training help for more advanced gesture recognition

Afterwards I decided to play around some more and learn about functional reactive programming with BaconJS along the way.

The following video shows the result, created as part of a 6 hour hackathon-like event. It uses BaconJS to handle bone movement, an OpenLayers 3 map to give it some visual output and BrainJS for a super simple and naive neural net based gesture recognition (fingers spread yes/no):
